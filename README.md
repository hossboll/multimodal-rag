# Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with Llama-index

This repository details the use of Llamaindex for multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) using images and text. It is a template for applications requiring document retrieval from various data sources.
To extend its functionality beyond Notion and images, you can easily select other Readers from Llama Hub, load them, and incorporate them into the workflow. Please refer to the notebook for more details.
